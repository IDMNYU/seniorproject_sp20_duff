# Midterm Project Demo

**Attendance for the Midterm Project Demo is MANDATORY on both dates.**

**Midterm Project Demo Prep**

* By or before Sunday at noon EST, please document your prototype\(s\) by posting the link\(s\) directly to the thing itself if it is a website \(incl. soundcloud links\), social media feed \(instagram, etc\), animatic or animation on vimeo or youtube, etc OR  posting link\(s\) from your process website which contain photos and/or videos of your prototype\(s\) to this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZdseARFH-GAUl_GSCIKApVZ-YRCHG9FqtXkFFrBNUOw/edit?usp=sharing).
* We will be using a different zoom link than the one used for class on Mon Mar 23.
* I will send you a calendar invite on Sunday Mar 29 with the zoom link. 
* The calendar invite description will also contain a link to the google doc which will contain which Monday and the time when you will be demoing your project, the project plans and links to the prototypes of our combined section, as well as a link to this webpage.
* I will also slack everyone the link to the google doc which contains the schedule on Sunday.
* **Please look at the project plans and prototypes of the students in your breakout group BEFORE class.** If everyone does this, you can spend less time talking and showing your project and more time getting feedback on your project.
* Also if you have been assigned a timekeeper, chat moderator, or have been asked to screenshot the chat and you are HIGHLY uncomfortable in doing so, please let me know ASAP. However, I want all students to participate actively during our midterm project demos.

**Midterm Project Demo** 

* Think of this as a show and tell.
* Be prepared to deliver an elevator pitch of your project verbally. 
* Be prepared to demo the project at its current state. 
* When you share your prototype\(s\) to the class during your midterm demo, try to bypass showing it on your process website. In other words, if you have images just show the images using preview, etc. If you have created a website, animatic or animation on vimeo or youtube, etc, go directly to that link in a web browser.
* Discuss what does \(and does not\) your prototype\(s\) explore at this moment in time. Quickly list next steps.
* You will have 14 min total to deliver your elevator pitch, demo your project, AND receive feedback from the group.
  * You will have up to 5 min to do both: deliver the elevator pitch and demo the project. You do not need to use the entire 5 min. That way you'll have more time for feedback.
  * The remaining time will be used for the rest of your breakout group to give you feedback.
  * The focus is on the actual artifact\(s\) you are creating and nothing else.
  * Do NOT create a supporting presentation.
* Also, make sure to also document your prototype\(s\) on your [process website](../pre-work/website.md) by creating post\(s\) which contain the link\(s\), photo\(s\), and/or video\(s\) of your prototype\(s\). More details below about demoing.

**Midterm Project Demo Setup**

* Our section will be combined with Alex Nathanson's section. 
* There will be at least 30 people in our zoom session.
* We will be broken up into zoom breakout rooms.
* Each breakout room should consist of at least 1 to 2 projects per date from both sections for a total of 7 to 8 students in each breakout room.
* Faculty and any "outside of our class" critics may or may not rotate in and out of breakout rooms.
* Each zoom breakout room will be assigned a student timekeeper, chat monitor, and a student to take screenshots of the chat.
  * Once you see the assignments on Sunday and you are uncomfortable with being either the timekeeper, chat monitor, or with taking screenshots let me know.
* Every student should have 14 min total to be fair. 
* Each student would present for up to 5 min and have the remaining time for feedback for a total of 14 min.

### Document your feedback ASAP 

#### preferably by the following day at the latest if at all possible

* Always document any feedback you receive on your [process website](../pre-work/website.md) after any critique. The midterm project demo is no different. 
  * This critique feedback post should include images of the current status of your project \(prototype\(s\)\), a description of your project progress as it currently stands, and a discussion of the feedback you received from the critique.
    * How will this feedback improve your project and progress?
    * Evaluate whether the prototype\(s\) gave you the feedback you require to transform or move forward with your project. If not, reflect upon why not.
* **NEW: Also post at least two comments in our class' main slack channel documenting the feedback you gave to at least two other classmates.** 

**Rules of the critique:**

* Do your best.
* Be present and engaged.
* Give feedback to your classmates. 
* Do not make assumptions. Ask questions.
* Do NOT take feedback personally.

**Guidelines for giving feedback during the critique:**

* What is working about the project?
* What is confusing or needs more clarification about the project?
* What are ways that the project can be improved?
* What additional references, resources, projects, and/or links would be useful for this project?

### Invite guests

It is the responsibility of each senior to invite an outside critic to _at least_ one of their project critiques, demos, or presentations. “Outside” might mean a faculty member from IDM, another NYU college, or another university altogether, a mentor from the professional world, an expert in your area of research, etc. If you are inviting an outside critic, please email me their name, title, company or org, and their email so I can send them a google calendar invite.

A one on one, documented meeting \(date, time, length, and typed notes\) with the outside critic can substitute for their presence at a project critique. Also, have the outside critic email me to confirm that they actually met with you.
