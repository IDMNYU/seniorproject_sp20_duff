# Midterm Project Demo

**Please consult** [**Project Demos**](project_demo.md) **for additional info.**

* We will be using a different zoom link than the one today.
* I will slack everyone the link and the schedule on Sunday morning.
* Please post links and/or photos and/or videos of your prototype\(s\) on this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZdseARFH-GAUl_GSCIKApVZ-YRCHG9FqtXkFFrBNUOw/edit?usp=sharing).
* Direct message me on slack when you have posted this. 
* Please post at the latest by Sunday March 29 at noon EST.

**Rules of the critique:**

* Be present and engaged \(i.e. Close your laptops and stow your cellphones\).
* Give feedback to your classmates. 
* Do not make assumptions. Ask questions.
* Do your best.
* Do NOT take feedback personally.

**Guidelines for the critique:**

* What is working about the project?
* What is confusing or needs more clarification about the project?
* What are ways that the project can be improved?
* What additional references, resources, projects, and/or links would be useful for this project?

## Additional Guidelines for your Project Demo

* You will demo the project at its current state.
* The focus is on the actual artifact you are creating and nothing else.
* Do NOT create a supporting presentation.

### Be prepared to discuss the following for your Project Demo

From Stephanie Houde and Charles Hill's _What do Prototypes prototype?_, prototypes provide a means to examine design problems.

* What does \(and does not\) your prototype explore at this moment in time?
* Evaluate whether the prototype gives you the feedback you require to transform or move forward with your project.

### Invite guests

It is the responsibility of each senior to invite an outside critic to _at least_ one of their project critiques, demos, or presentations. “Outside” might mean a faculty member from IDM, another NYU college, or another university altogether, a mentor from the professional world, an expert in your area of research, etc. A one on one, documented meeting \(date, time, length, and typed notes\) with the outside critic can substitute for their presence at a project critique. Also, have the outside critic email me to confirm that they actually met with you.

### Document your feedback

Always document any feedback you receive on your [process website](../pre-work/website.md) after any critique. This critique feedback post should include images of the current status of your project \(prototype or version\), a description of your project progress as it currently stands and discussion of the feedback your received from the critique. How will this feedback improve your work and ideas?
