# Midterm Project Demo

**Midterm Project Demo is MANDATORY on both dates.**

**Midterm Project Demo Logistics**

* We will be using a different zoom link than the one today.
* I will send you a calendar invite on Sunday March 29th with the zoom link. There will be relevant information in the calendar invite description.
* I will slack everyone the link and the schedule on Sunday at noon.
* Please post links and/or photos and/or videos of your prototype\(s\) on this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZdseARFH-GAUl_GSCIKApVZ-YRCHG9FqtXkFFrBNUOw/edit?usp=sharing).
  * Direct message me on slack when you have posted this. 
  * Please post at the latest by Sunday March 29 at noon EST. 

**Midterm Project Demo Setup**

* Our section will be combined with Alex Nathanson's section. 
* There will be at least 30 people in our zoom session.
* We will be broken up into zoom breakout rooms.
* Each breakout room should consist of at least 1 to 2 projects per date from both sections for a total of 7 to 8 students in each breakout room.
* Faculty and any "outside of our class" critics may or may not rotate in and out of breakout rooms.
* Each zoom breakout room will be assigned a student timekeeper, chat monitor, and a student to take screenshots of the chat.
  * Once you see the assignments on Sunday and you are uncomfortable with being either the timekeeper, chat monitor, or with taking screenshots let me know.
* Every student should have 14 min total to be fair. 
* Each student would present for up to 5 min and have the remaining time for feedback for a total of 14 min.

**Rules of the critique:**

* Be present and engaged \(i.e. Close your laptops and stow your cellphones\).
* Give feedback to your classmates. 
* Do not make assumptions. Ask questions.
* Do your best.
* Do NOT take feedback personally.

**Guidelines for the critique:**

* What is working about the project?
* What is confusing or needs more clarification about the project?
* What are ways that the project can be improved?
* What additional references, resources, projects, and/or links would be useful for this project?

## Additional Guidelines for your Midterm Project Demo

* You will demo the project at its current state.
* The focus is on the actual artifact you are creating and nothing else.
* Do NOT create a supporting presentation.

### Be prepared to discuss the following for your Project Demo

From Stephanie Houde and Charles Hill's _What do Prototypes prototype?_, prototypes provide a means to examine design problems.

* What does \(and does not\) your prototype explore at this moment in time?
* Evaluate whether the prototype gives you the feedback you require to transform or move forward with your project.

### Invite guests

It is the responsibility of each senior to invite an outside critic to _at least_ one of their project critiques, demos, or presentations. “Outside” might mean a faculty member from IDM, another NYU college, or another university altogether, a mentor from the professional world, an expert in your area of research, etc. A one on one, documented meeting \(date, time, length, and typed notes\) with the outside critic can substitute for their presence at a project critique. Also, have the outside critic email me to confirm that they actually met with you.

### Document your feedback

Always document any feedback you receive on your [process website](../pre-work/website.md) after any critique. This critique feedback post should include images of the current status of your project \(prototype or version\), a description of your project progress as it currently stands and discussion of the feedback your received from the critique. How will this feedback improve your work and ideas?
