# End of Semester Deliverables

At the beginning of the semester, create a google drive folder labeled "Senior Project SP20 your first and last name" \(i.e. Senior Project SP20 De Angela Duff\) and share with deangela.duff@nyu.edu.

Over the course of the semester, you should upload the corresponding files and folders.
