# End of Semester Deliverables

At the beginning of the semester, create a google drive folder labeled "Senior Project SP20 your first and last name" \(i.e. Senior Project SP20 De Angela Duff\) and share with deangela.duff@nyu.edu.

Over the course of the semester, you should upload the corresponding files and folders.  
  
NEW:

* [Process](pdf_or_book.md) pdf
* [Project Documentation](project_documentation.md) folder
* [Final Self-assessment](final_self_assessment.md) pdf
* [Letter To Next Cohort](letter_to_next_cohort.md) file 

OLD: You should already have the following. Just drag and drop in the folder if you haven't already.

* [Midterm Self-assessment](midterm_self_assessment.md) pdf
* [Pecha Kucha presentation](../pre-work/pecha_kucha.md) exported as a pdf
