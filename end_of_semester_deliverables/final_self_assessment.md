## Reflection

Any action without reflection is meaningless; real learning only occurs as part of a reflective process. Reflection is studying your own practice as seriously as you study anything; it involves thinking about why, what, and how you create something. In any learning situation you should study beforehand, make/do, debug, reflect, adjust, and do it all over again. Learning happens in a cycle, illustrated in the diagrams below.

As a student, you should also develop your critical thinking skills. This will initially involve critiquing other peopleâ€™s work but ultimately you also want to be able to critique your own work. This will allow you to develop as a creator.

**Of Project**

* Do your deliverables match your initial concept \(or last impact statement\)?
* Did you do what you said you were going to do \(integrity, accountability\)?
* Did you execute all aspects of your project by the best means possible \(craft and care\)?
* Lessons Learned / What would you do differently if you could redo this project?

**Of Self**
