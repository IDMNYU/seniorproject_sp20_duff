## Reflection

Any action without reflection is meaningless; real learning only occurs as part of a reflective process. Reflection is studying your own practice as seriously as you study anything; it involves thinking about why, what, and how you create something. In any learning situation you should study beforehand, make/do, debug, reflect, adjust, and do it all over again. Learning happens in a cycle, illustrated in the diagrams below.

As a student, you should also develop your critical thinking skills. This will initially involve critiquing other peopleâ€™s work but ultimately you also want to be able to critique your own work. This will allow you to develop as a creator.

**Of Project**

* Critically analyze/evaluate your senior project **process**.
* At this point in time, what qualitative description would you give your overall process and why? \(i.e. excellent, very good, good, etc. Consult the grading overview descriptions presented earlier in the [syllabus](../syllabus.md).\)
* Reflect upon your project's progress at this point in time.
* What feedback about your project \(from anyone\) has been the most useful to you and why?
* What are your open issues?
* What are your risks of failure \(lack of tech, time, knowledge, money, etc.\)?
* Create a contingency plan for major risks.
