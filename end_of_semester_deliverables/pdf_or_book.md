# Process pdf

I suggest using **Adobe InDesign** to compile this, but you can use other programs if you choose to do so.

I would use the [project plan](../project_plan/) _as a guideline_ for the structure of this pdf or book, and your process website, project demos, and project presentations for content. This pdf or book should illustrate and describe your project process over the course of the semester. Include details of how you did research, design, prototyping, and development. Also discuss how your project changed directions along the way and what you learned over the course of the semester. Include descriptions and images of your project at various stages \(prototypes and versions\) and an image of your final project. You should also consider layout and design elements of the pdf or book.

Upload all drafts including the final version to a folder labeled _end of semester pdf \(or book\)_ in your project documentation folder for your [end of semester deliverables](./).

Here are some examples:

You can make the blurb books fullscreen by clicking the expansion arrow above the image of the book. The third icon.

### Final Version

* Please name your file as lastname\_senior\_sp20.pdf \(i.e. duff\_senior\_sp20.pdf\) 
* No need to do: If pdf, **post on slack** for everyone to see and download in the class
* Not applicable this semester: If physical book, post the link to the preview on blurb on slack AND bring the actual book. Make sure the book is public and that you can preview the entire book. If you can't figure out how to preview it on blurb, upload a pdf of the book to the senior project channel on slack.

## Because of the impact of COVID-19, I am removing this extra credit option. ~~\(OPTIONAL instead of PDF\) END OF SEMESTER BOOK REQUIREMENTS~~

See the end of semester pdf requirements above and adopt them in book format instead IF YOU WANT EXTRA CREDIT.

I highly suggest blurb
