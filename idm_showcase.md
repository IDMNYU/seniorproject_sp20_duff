## IDM Showcase   

* Date to TBD. Most likely it will be early May.

Your senior project will be publicly shown in the IDM showcase at the end of the semester (date to be determined). Exhibiting your work is truly a gift of accomplishment, response, and feedback. If you don't understand the benefits of exhibiting your work, I HIGHLY recommend that you read [Show Your Work!](http://www.amazon.com/Show-Your-Work-Creativity-Discovered-ebook/dp/B00GU2RGGI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1420589663&sr=8-1&keywords=show+the+work+austin+kleon) by Austin Kleon ([Cheat Sheet](https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1384352860i/6856374._SY540_.jpg).
