## Personal Kanban / Project Milestones
**Break down** EVERYTHING you need to do for **your project into actionable tasks** using <a href="http://personalkanban.com" target="_blank">Personal Kanban</a>. All actionable tasks should start with a verb (i.e. write, call, email, build, collect, etc.). 

I recommend using an analog, digital or analog/digital combination. 
<ul>
<li>post-it notes on a wall or mini ones in a notebook (so you can move them around)
OR</li>
<li>a digital representation of your milestones using <a href="http://kanbanery.com" target="_blank">kanbanery.com</a> or another digital platform of your choice.</li>
</ul>

The columns I recommend for Personal Kanban (but you are not limited to) are:
* To-Do
* Today (Work-In-Progress (WIP) limit of 3 to 5 maximum)
* Waiting For (OPTIONAL)
* Done

If you use Kanbanery.com, please go to **Settings**, and under **General Settings** **enable** a *public URL* and make sure you press **Update** at the bottom of the General Settings page. Then, copy and paste your public URL to slack as a comment to the specific kanbanery.com message.
