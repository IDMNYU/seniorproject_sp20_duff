# Project Plan

<strong>This project plan will be constantly iterated over the course of the semester. It may grow and/or shrink over the course of the semester. Don't worry about "getting it right." The creative process is messy. 

Please remember you and a classmate can work as a team. Only one presentation and proposal is to be submitted per team.</strong>

The project plan will consist of a presentation and a written proposal.

* Please name your file as lastname_senior_projectplandraft#_date.pdf (i.e. duff_senior_projectplan1_2016jan15.pdf). If a team, put both of your last names (i.e. duff_and_dubois)
* Please note that any significant changes to your project will require the submission of a revised project plan.
* Upload drafts to a folder labeled *project plan* in your project documentation folder for your [end of semester deliverables](end_of_semester_presentation.md).

<tr>
    <td><strong>Project Milestones</strong></td>
    <td>How are you achieving this?
    <ul>
    <li>Break down your milestones into actionable tasks using a system of your choice. I highly recommend <a href="http://personalkanban.com" target="_blank">Personal Kanban</a>. However, it is not required if you have another system with prioritization as a focus. If you have another system, you must share it with the instructor.</li>
    <li>All actionable tasks should start with a verb (i.e. write, call, email, build, code, collect, etc.), and can be completed in a day.</li> 
    <li>Also be specific with your tasks. (For example, "take 20 photographs" is more explicit than "take photographs". "Take 5 photos of tigers, 5 photos of bears, 5 photos of lizards, and 5 photos of cats" is more explicit than "take 20 photographs".)</li>
    </ul></td>

<tr>
    <td><strong>Research</strong></td>        
    <td>Including, but not limited to, brainstorming (mind maps, word lists, etc.), readings, screenings / viewings, tech research, material research, visual research, collection, interviews, observation, etc.
        <ul>
        <li>You should decide what kinds of research / reference / influences is most appropriate for your project.</li>

    <td>Including, but not limited to, design sketches, process maps, drawings, wireframes / schematics, storyboards, comps, mood boards, concept boards, screen shots, videos, diagrams, images 
        <ul>
        <li>You should decide the most appropriate medium of delivery and which processes are most appropriate for your project.</li>
        </ul>
    </td>
</tr> 
<tr>  
<tr>
    <td><strong>Development</strong></td> 
    <td><strong>Prototype(s)</strong> – including, but not limited to, exercises, tests, models, maquettes, animatics 
        <ul>
        <li>You should know what the concept of a prototype is but, if you do not know, a prototype “is an early sample or model built to test a concept or process or to act as a thing to be replicated or learned from.”</li>
        <li>As a result, a prototype can take on many forms. Essentially, it is your project or aspects of your project in an unfinished form.</li>
        <li>You should decide what kinds of prototype(s) are most appropriate for your project.</li>
        </ul>
    <strong>Project Versions</strong> - Alpha, Beta, and Gold refer to a project’s life cycle.
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Alpha</strong> Version is the testing phase of form and functionality</li>
        <li><strong>Beta</strong> Version is when the functionality, form, and implementation is complete as possible. It is ready for user testing.</li>
        <li><strong>Gold</strong> Version is when all the bugs have been fixed and quality is assured. It is ready to go public.</li>
        </ul>
    The specific parameters and expectations of each version for every student will be individually determined in consultation with the professor.</td>
