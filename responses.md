## Responses  

* Include title of media as title of your post.
* Post to slack AND upload to your project documentation folder for your [end of semester deliverables](end_of_semester_presentation.md).
* Please name your file as lastname_senior_sp20_responsekeyword.pdf where keyword identifies what you are responding to.

After interacting with a reading, audio, video, or exhibition, post a short response on your process website about what resonated with you the most. Do not summarize—in other words, do not regurgitate it. Rather, you should discuss any epiphanies or insights that occurred for you. Describe how the experience may or may not reflect your own project and process. Will it inform or change your project or process in any way? Why or why not?

Answer the following questions:
* Three key point(s) (or the most useful or valuable thing(s) you learned) from this resource, and why.
* Is there anything you disagree with and why? Or anything you do differently or would do differently?
* How does the resource connect with or break from your prior knowledge? 
* Any confusing points?
