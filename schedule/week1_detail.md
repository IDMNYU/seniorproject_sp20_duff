We will learn about the history of ethnographic theory and methods and how they can be used for digital practices and contexts. The course will cover specific ethnographic techniques, including participant-observation, ethnographic interviewing, and taking field notes, and additional methods such as content analysis and online data collection. Along with these methods, we will consider a range of theoretical perspectives necessary to doing fieldwork in digital contexts and to analyzing qualitative data.
