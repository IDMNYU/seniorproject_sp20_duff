## Class

**Announcements:** 

If your schedule permits, I would highly recommend you take the following humanities elective to help with your research for your senior project.   
  
**STS-UY 3904 Digital Ethnography MW 3:00pm-4:50pm**   
This course provides an overview of ethnographic and qualitative methods for conducting research on digital, social, and mobile technologies. We will learn about the history of ethnographic theory and methods and how they can be used for digital practices and contexts. The course will cover specific ethnographic techniques, including participant-observation, ethnographic interviewing, and taking field notes, and additional methods such as content analysis and online data collection. Along with these methods, we will consider a range of theoretical perspectives necessary to doing fieldwork in digital contexts and to analyzing qualitative data. This course involves hands-on practice and participation to prepare students to conduct their own digital research projects.

**Students** can get free headshots from the [NYU Photo Bureau](https://www.nyu.edu/about/leadership-university-administration/office-of-the-president/university-relationsandpublicaffairs/public-affairs/photo-bureau.html). I highly recommend that you take advantage of it for your portfolio website and LinkedIn profile. It's a very popular service. You just need to book it \(sometimes weeks\) in advance. The NYU photo bureau is currently moving locations. So they're not taking any appointments until February.
