## Audio (Optional) / Visual (Required) Storytelling Exercise

*Post as a pdf to your project website but also be prepared to present from your computer.*

Select 20 images that create a visual story about your project idea (no text). Create a google presentation or compile into a pdf (one image per screen) and be prepared to talk **briefly** about each image you select (for approximately 20 sec each). 

There are two options:
* If you already have a project idea, this audio (optional), visual (required) presentation should cover all perspectives, concepts and ideas you can think about. Don’t limit yourself but broaden up.
* If you do not have a specific project, select 20 things that you consider relevant for living in 2020 or 20 things that you are interested in.
