## Audio (Optional) / Visual (Required) Storytelling Exercise
* Please note that this is an optional exercise for brainstorming.
* Please name your file as lastname_senior_sp20_storytelling.pdf
* Use google slides and the [pecha kucha](pecha_kucha.md) (20 slides x 20 sec) format. 
* Export as a pdf and upload to your project documentation folder for your [end of semester deliverables](end_of_semester_deliverables.md).

Select 20 images that create a visual story about your project idea (no text). 
One image per screen. 
Be prepared to talk **briefly** about each image you select (20 seconds goes by fast). 

There are two options:
* If you already have a project idea, this audio (optional), visual (required) presentation should cover all perspectives, concepts and ideas you can think about. Don’t limit yourself but broaden up.
* If you do not have a specific project, select 20 things that you consider relevant for living in 2020 or 20 things that you are interested in.
